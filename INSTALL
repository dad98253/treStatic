This library is customized for use with the passwin program. It should not be installed in
any system directories. passwin will be configured to link ot it directly from its build
folder.

To configure and build it:
git clone ...
cd treStatic

autoreconf
./configure --disable-wchar --disable-agrep  --disable-multibyte
make

Note that the first time you run autoreconf, you will likely get messages about missine files.
Just follow the instuctions in the error message to use automake to create the missing files.
Then, re-run autoreconf and continue...

to clean just the object and lib files:
make clean

to also clean the autoconf/automake files:
make distclean

to create a package file (to backup or move you work someplace else):
make dist
